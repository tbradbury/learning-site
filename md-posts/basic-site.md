To have a site to pratice and expirement on, I've create this site using **Next.js**. 

This was create using `npx create-next-app` and then using the **Next.js** [intro tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) to get a simple site with blog posts.

The blog posts are writen in **Markdown** and then rendered into the app as per the [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/data-fetching)

On a more complicated site you'd replace this with fetching data from a backend source probably using **Graphql**
